This project is a search and filtering page built using Next.js, integrating various features for an enhanced user experience. It dynamically updates search queries, applies filters, and provides efficient API integration for real-time data retrieval.

## Features
- **Next.js with TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better code maintainability.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Optimizes performance and SEO.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Enhances response time by reducing redundant API calls.
- **Dynamic Search Functionality**: Retrieves and displays search results based on user input.
- **Filtering System**: Allows users to refine search results by various parameters (status, owners, attorneys, law firms, etc.).
- **Pagination**: Supports navigation through multiple pages of results.
- **State Management (useState, useEffect)**: Manages application state efficiently.
- **Routing with Query Parameters**: Updates URL parameters dynamically for search and filters.
- **Share Button Functionality**: Generates a sharable link containing all applied filters and search results.
